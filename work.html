                        <p>To catch a glimpse of a fox can really seem like a visual treasure.  
                            They are so stealthy and alert, that it seems they notice us even when we 
                            glance at them from the windows of our house.  We have caught sight 
                            of our little neighbor only a handful of times in all of the years 
                            we have been sharing this hill together.  A particularly restful 
                            and quite evening invited our neighbor to steal a quick nap under 
                            the greenery.</p>

                        <p>My neice loves giraffe.  She asked me some time ago to paint one for her, and of course 
                            I could not refuse.  I had never painted a giraffe.  The subject had simplky never occurred to me. 
                            I cannot say I cross paths with giraffe often here on the hill.  
                            As I studied them I found them delightfully facinating, from the way their strangely 
                            long neck balances, to the fuzzy horns they bear, and of course that delightful 
                            pattern!  The experience further reinforced why one should be open to new ideas and 
                            experiences.</p>

                            and moss seemed to shift the light into a most peaceful shade.

                            It is a little bumpy and uneven.  Weeds and bushes are constantly fighting 
                            for a place along it&rsquo;s edges.  Trimming and keeping such a long path 
                            can be quite a chore, but it brings me joy each and every time I return.  
                            It is the first to greet me and welcome me home, pleasantly sheltered 
                            by the shade of trees along either side.

                        <p>If one ever heard the call of a screech owl, but had never seen one, it might 
                            be surprising to know how small they are.  Our little neighbor is certainly
                             the most talkative of the local crew. Our hill&rsquo;s guardian seems to 
                             simultaneously welcome the evening and warn away others, noting this hill 
                             has already been laid claim.  I think this work took a subconciously impressionist
                            turn, as the thought of the sounds and calls of our little neighbor certainly influenced 
                            the wild, sketchy lines and jagged marks that found their way onto the page.

                        <p>This is one of my illustration-style pieces: an attempt to capture a lazy, warm 
                            day in which our little feline friend has found a delightfully shady spot in a 
                            quiet corner of town in which to nap.  If I recall now, this was inspired by 
                            animation cell image, though that piece has long since been lost to me.  I love 
                            the way the light plays across the fruit, the stones, and the edges of the leaves 
                            that it reaches.

                        <p>We had a patch of sunflowers grow and bloom from a corner of 
                            our house one year where the birds had been particularly 
                            picky, messy eaters, tossing many of the sunflower seeds onto 
                            the ground.  I did enjoy watching them track the sun, 
                            and one particularly sunny day was inspired to catch one as it 
                            stared up into the vibrant blue sky.  This piece has an impressionist 
                            air to it, most notably the &rsquo;ripples&rsquo; in the sky.  I do 
                            enjoy that dreamy haze of the chalk pastels.

                            requesting. She stares at me with anticipation each time, expecting 
                            that perhaps this time she may finally have conveyed her 
                            royal orders to her rather dim subject.  Alas, I think I may never 
                            get it quite right, but she playfully tolerates me and my attempts to 
                            please her all the same.

                            as our walks brought us down into their space.  These days they give 
                            us an occasional glance, but mostly just go about their business.  The 
                            large crows have become especially bold, and will barely show us a care 
                            as we pass by very close.  I feel like they give us an amused glare, as 
                            if to wonder why we keep just walking around that path when there are 
                            so many treats to find.

                            looking over a large lake or ocean.  It has certainly attracted many new 
                            residents who seem to at least tolerate all of the additional foot and 
                            bike traffic that the new trails have brought into their homeland.
