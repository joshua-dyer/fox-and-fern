                        <h3>Brooklyn's Giraffe</h3>
                        <p>My neice loves giraffe.  She asked me some time ago to paint one for her, and of course 
                            I could not refuse.  I had never painted a giraffe, and really had never been interested.  
                            As I studied them I found them delightfully facinating, from the way their strangely 
                            long neck balances, to the fuzzy horns they bear, and of course that delightful 
                            pattern!  What an interesting discovery they were.  The experience further reinforced 
                            why we should be open to new ideas and experiences, even if they do not at first seem 
                            to align with our usual interests.  Painted in watercolor.</p>

                        <p>In addition to nature painting, I've always been interested in buildings.  
                            This one carries a touch of whimsy and playfulness, with bright colors and 
                            exaggerated proportions.  Painted in watercolor with graphite on paper.</p>

                            hills to explore.  They can seem almost endless, allowing one to wander 
                            til their heart&rsquo;s content.  This lovely day the green of the grass 
                            and moss seemed to shift the light into a most peaceful shade.  Captured 
                            here in mixed media on paper.

                        <p>Each day I return home I am greeted by this quaint graveled, grassy path. 
                            It is a little bumpy and uneven.  Weeds and bushes are constantly fighting 
                            for a place along it&rsquo;s edges.  Trimming and keeping such a long path 
                            can be quite a chore, but it brings me joy each and every time I return.  
                            It is the first to greet me and welcome me home, pleasantly sheltered 
                            by the shade of trees along either side.  Drawn in Graphite in my sketchbook.

                        <h3>Screech Owl</h3>
                        <p>If one has ever heard the call of a screech owl, it might be surprising 
                            to know how small they actually are.  We have a surprising number of owls 
                            around us, but our little neighbor is certainly the most talkative of the 
                            crew. The little owl seems to welcome each evening as the time to search 
                            for the nightly dinner is announced, warning away any others that might be 
                            planning on encroaching on the territory which has already been laid claim 
                            by our little guardian.  I think this work took a subconciously impressionist
                            turn, as the thought of the sounds and calls of our little neighbor certainly influenced 
                            the wild, sketchy lines and jagged marks that found their way onto the page.

                        <h3>Cat Nap</h3>
                        <p>This is one of my illustration-style pieces: an attempt to capture a lazy, warm 
                            day in which our little feline friend has found a delightfully shady spot in a 
                            quiet corner of town in which to nap.  If I recall now, this was inspired by 
                            animation cell image, though that piece has long since been lost to me.  I love 
                            the way the light plays across the fruit, the stones, and the edges of the leaves 
                            that it reaches.  Ink and watercolor on paper.

                        <p>We had a patch of sunflowers grow and bloom from a corner of 
                            our house one year where the birds had been particularly 
                            picky, messy eaters, tossing many of the sunflower seeds onto 
                            the ground.  I did enjoy watching them track the sun, 
                            and one particularly sunny day was inspired to catch one as it 
                            stared up into the vibrant blue sky.  This piece has an impressionist 
                            air to it, most notably the &rsquo;ripples&rsquo; in the sky.  I do 
                            enjoy that dreamy haze of the chalk pastels.  Chalk pastel on paper.

                        <h3>Anticipation</h3>
                        <p>Our sweet cat Niki, as many cats do, has such a 
                            peculiar way that she stares at me while we discuss her needs.  I 
                            am quite certain that I have never fully understood what it is she is 
                            after, but as she stares at me with anticipation each time, expecting 
                            that perhaps this time she may finally have conveyed her 
                            royal orders to her rather dim subject.  Alas, I think I may never 
                            get it quite right, but she playfully tolerates me and my attempts to 
                            please her all the same.  A barely passable attempt to capture her 
                            lofty stare in graphite and charcoal on paper.
